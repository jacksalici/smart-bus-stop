# üöè IoT powered smart bus stop

**To improve the mobility of citizens in a city/metropolis, that is, enabling fast, easy and safe travel, and at the same time, lower management costs for the administrators.**


## Abstract

This project, made as the final project of the IoT course of the Master's Degree in CS, focuses on improving public transportation, particularly through city buses. The aim is to create a smart bus stop, which allows easier access to the service and enables (through a network of such stations) an enhancement of the service.

Each smart bus stop is going to be equipped with a digital kiosk/totem device and a button board. A solar panel could also be provided to the station to make it self-sufficient during sunny hours.

The totem allows people to see the real-time location of public transportation, with any transit times through the various stations. It also makes it possible to purchase tickets on the spot, making it easy for people without a mobile device to reserve a seat and plan a trip. 
There could be the possibility of authenticating people via NFC/RFID so that the user interface could be better profiled.

For people with disabilities, a button is provided to alert the driver to give help or attention.

Once the network of smart stations is established, it will be possible to perform statistical analysis and forecasting on the use of a certain line, allowing better allocation of resources (add/delete a bus, "dynamic" lines).

Since bus stops are well recognizable and present in cities one could exploit them as points where to allocate emergency medical instruments (AEDs) or buttons to immediately call for help. Similarly, it is possible to use them as air quality monitoring points.
