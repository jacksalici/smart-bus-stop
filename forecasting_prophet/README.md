# People count Forecasting âœ¨

We developed with Prophet a **forecasting model** to predict the number of people waiting at the stops in a future moment based on the past recorded data. Since it is just a demo project the recorded data was generated using a script, so the model is not accurate.

> Documentation will be added soon.
